PROJECT TITLE: 0x1D. C - Binary trees

WHAT ARE BINARY TREES? 
Well...There are "trees" that represent a parent node that has two nodes fromt it known as left child and right child.

Properties of binary trees
1. Number of n nodes in a full bianry tree is at least 2h+1 and at most 2^h+1 - , where h is the height.
2. The number of leaf nodes l in a perferct binary tree is l = (n +2)/2, where the number of nodes in the tree

COMMON OPERATIONS IN BINARY TREES
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Searching
4. Traversing

Note: Binary trees use recursion, this helps in reducing the time complexity of running a program

Have Fun!!!!
